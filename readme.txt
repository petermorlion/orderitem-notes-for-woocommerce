A plugin to allow notes on order items in WooCommerce.

== Description ==

You can currently add notes to an order in WooCommerce, but you can't add notes to individual order items.
This plugin makes it easy for administrators to add notes to individual order items of a WooCommerce order.

Once activated, each order item in the Admin interface will have a textbox:

![WooCommerce Order Item Notes interface](assets/screenshot-1.png "WooCommerce Order Item Notes interface")

Enter your notes and save the order. Your notes will now show when you load the order in the future.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
